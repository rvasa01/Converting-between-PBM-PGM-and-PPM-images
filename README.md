# Converting-between-PBM-PGM-and-PPM-images

In this project, I utilized C programming to execute pixel operations on 2D arrays, facilitating the conversion between PBM, PGM, and PPM files. Memory allocation was achieved using the malloc function. The primary code files written by me are "ppmcvt.c" (the file where I performed command line parsing as well as pixel operations) and "pbm_aux.c,"(the file where I allocated memory for the pixels, with the help of malloc) while the remaining files in the folder were provided to me.
